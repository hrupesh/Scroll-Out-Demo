ScrollOut

Animate on Scroll

Why should I use this?

Animate or reveal elements as they scroll into view using CSS or JavaScript
Super tiny JavaScript library at 1KB minified and gzipped.

How do I use it?

Install ScrollOut and decorate elements with the data-scroll attribute. As elements become visible, data-scroll will be set to in and when elements are scrolled out they will be set with out. Add your own CSS or JS to make a big impression when things come into view. That's it!
